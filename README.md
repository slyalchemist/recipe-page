## My process
- For this code, I began by establishing the basic structure of the webpage via the HTML source. 
- Once I was satisfied with the basic structure, I began styling to make my webpage similar to the final outcome. 
- As I was going back and forth between the HTML and CSS files I kept finding smaller things I needed to tweak to get a close as possible to the objective. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I improved my skills with the flexbox and overall styling with CSS. There weren't many issues I faced with this project. 

### Continued development

- I would like to keep getting more comfortable with the flexbox as it is a priceless tool.

- I would also like to continue improving my skills with styling with CSS. 

### Useful resources

- I didn't quite refer to any resources with this project! It was mostly just refining skills I already had.
